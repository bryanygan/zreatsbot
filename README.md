## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- `pip` for package management

## Installation

1. **Clone or download the bot files**:
   ```bash
   mkdir combined-discord-bot
   cd combined-discord-bot
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

1. **Environment variables**: Create a `.env` file in the project root:

   ```dotenv
   # Required
   BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
   OWNER_ID=123456789012345678
   
   # Optional - comment out features you don't need
   POINTS_CHANNEL_ID=1234567890123456789
   OPENER_CHANNEL_ID=1234567890123456789
   ROLE_PING_ID=1352022044614590494
   VIP_ROLE_ID=1371247728646033550
   ORDER_CHANNEL_MENTION=<#1350935337269985334>
   ```

2. **Database initialization**: On first run, the bot will auto-create:
   - `data/pool.db` for cards and emails
   - `data/points.db` for user points
   - `logs/` directory for command logging

## Running the Bot

```bash
python combined_bot.py
```

The bot will display which features are configured:
```
üöÄ Starting combined Discord bot...
üìç Points channel: 1234567890123456789
üîì Opener channel: 1234567890123456789
üëë Owner ID: 123456789012345678
```

## Migrating from Separate Bots

### From Order Command Bot (Python)
1. **Database migration**: Copy your existing `data/pool.db` file to the new bot directory
2. **Logs migration**: Copy your `logs/` directory to preserve command history
3. **Environment variables**: Copy `BOT_TOKEN` and `OWNER_ID` from your `.env` file

### From Counter Bot (Node.js) 
1. **Points migration**: The Node.js bot used `quick.db` which stores data in `json.sqlite`. You'll need to migrate this data:
   ```python
   # Migration script (run once)
   import sqlite3
   import json
   
   # Read from quick.db format
   conn_old = sqlite3.connect('json.sqlite')  # Your old Node.js bot's DB
   cursor_old = conn_old.cursor()
   cursor_old.execute("SELECT key, value FROM json WHERE key LIKE 'points.%'")
   rows = cursor_old.fetchall()
   
   # Write to new format
   conn_new = sqlite3.connect('data/points.db')
   cursor_new = conn_new.cursor()
   for key, value in rows:
       user_id = key.replace('points.', '')
       points = json.loads(value)
       cursor_new.execute("INSERT OR REPLACE INTO points (user_id, points) VALUES (?, ?)", (user_id, points))
   
   conn_new.commit()
   conn_old.close()
   conn_new.close()
   ```
2. **Channel ID**: Set `POINTS_CHANNEL_ID` in `.env` to your existing points channel

### From Channel Opener Bot (Python)
1. **Channel ID**: Set `OPENER_CHANNEL_ID` in `.env` to your existing opener channel
2. **Role configuration**: Update `ROLE_PING_ID`, `VIP_ROLE_ID`, and `ORDER_CHANNEL_MENTION` as needed

## Configuration Options

### Required Settings
- `BOT_TOKEN` - Your Discord bot token
- `OWNER_ID` - Discord user ID for admin commands

### Optional Settings (comment out if not using)
- `POINTS_CHANNEL_ID` - Channel where images earn points
- `OPENER_CHANNEL_ID` - Channel where open/close commands work
- `ROLE_PING_ID` - Role to ping when opening (default: 1352022044614590494)
- `VIP_ROLE_ID` - Role assigned with "Perm Fee" redemption (default: 1371247728646033550)
- `ORDER_CHANNEL_MENTION` - Channel mention in open announcement (default: <#1350935337269985334>)

### Card/Email Pool Constants
The following are hardcoded in the bot but can be modified in the source:
- `EXP_MONTH = '06'` - Credit card expiration month
- `EXP_YEAR = '30'` - Credit card expiration year  
- `ZIP_CODE = '19104'` - ZIP code for orders

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Card pool is empty" or "Email pool is empty"**
- Use `/add_card` and `/add_email` commands or bulk upload files
- Check that your databases were properly migrated

**"Could not find order embed"**
- Ensure the ticket bot's first message contains at least 2 embeds
- The bot looks for the second embed in the first message of the channel

**Points not being awarded**
- Verify `POINTS_CHANNEL_ID` is set correctly
- Check that the bot has permissions to read messages and send replies in that channel
- Ensure images have proper MIME types (image/*)

**Channel rename not working**
- Check bot has "Manage Channels" permission
- Verify `OPENER_CHANNEL_ID` matches the intended channel
- Remember there's a 2 renames per 10 minutes rate limit (Discord's limitation)

**Commands not appearing**
- Bot needs "applications.commands" scope when invited
- Commands sync automatically on startup
- Try `/` in Discord to see if commands appear

**Permission errors**
- Bot needs appropriate permissions in each channel it operates in:
  - View Channel, Send Messages, Read Message History (all channels)
  - Manage Channels (opener channel)
  - Manage Roles (for VIP role assignment)

### Database Issues

**Corrupted pool.db**
- The bot automatically detects and recreates corrupted SQLite files
- Your data will be lost if this happens - keep backups of working databases

**Points not persisting**
- Check that `data/` directory has write permissions
- Ensure `data/points.db` is being created and is writable

### Logging Issues

**No log files created**
- Logs are only created when order commands are used
- Check that `logs/` directory has write permissions
- Use `/log_stats` to verify logging is working

**Log commands showing no data**
- Logs are organized by month (YYYYMM format)
- Use `/log_stats month:202405` for specific months
- JSON files must be valid - corruption will cause read errors

## Security Considerations

- All command responses are ephemeral (only visible to command user)
- Only the configured `OWNER_ID` can execute admin commands
- Card numbers and emails are logged in full - secure your log files appropriately
- Database files contain sensitive payment information - implement appropriate backups and security
- Consider rotating cards/emails regularly and removing old entries

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Reward Types
To add new reward types to the `/redeem` command, modify the choices in the command definition:
```python
@app_commands.choices(reward=[
    app_commands.Choice(name='Free Order', value='Free Order'),
    app_commands.Choice(name='Perm Fee', value='Perm Fee'),
    app_commands.Choice(name='Custom Reward', value='Custom Reward'),  # Add this
])
```

### Changing Point Values
To award different point amounts, modify the points tracking section:
```python
# Change from 1 to any value
new_points = bot.add_user_points(user_id, 2)  # Awards 2 points instead of 1
```

### Custom Card Expiration
Update the constants at the top of the file:
```python
EXP_MONTH = '12'  # December
EXP_YEAR = '25'   # 2025
ZIP_CODE = '90210'  # Beverly Hills
```
