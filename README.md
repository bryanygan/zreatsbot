## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- `pip` for package management

## Installation

1. **Clone or download the bot files**:
   ```bash
   mkdir combined-discord-bot
   cd combined-discord-bot
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

1. **Environment variables**: Create a `.env` file in the project root:

   ```dotenv
   # Required
   BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
   OWNER_ID=123456789012345678
   
   # Optional - comment out features you don't need
   POINTS_CHANNEL_ID=1234567890123456789  # For role assignment
   OPENER_CHANNEL_ID=1234567890123456789  # For open/close commands
   ROLE_PING_ID=1352022044614590494       # Role to ping when opening
   VIP_ROLE_ID=1371247728646033550        # VIP role for redemptions
   ORDER_CHANNEL_MENTION=<#1350935337269985334>  # Channel mention in announcements
   ```

2. **Database initialization**: On first run, the bot will auto-create:
   - `data/pool.db` for cards and emails
   - `logs/` directory for command logging

## Running the Bot

```bash
python combinedbot.py

## Bulk File Formats

### Cards (bulk_cards)
Create a `.txt` file with one card per line:

## Using Custom Cards/Emails

All order commands now support custom cards and emails that bypass the pool:

```bash
# Use custom card and email (doesn't consume from pool)
/fusion_assist mode:UberEats email:custom@gmail.com card_number:1234567812345678 card_cvv:123

# Use custom email with pool card
/fusion_order custom_email:custom@gmail.com

# Use pool resources (consumes from pool)
/fusion_order
```

## Configuration Options

### Required Settings
- `BOT_TOKEN` - Your Discord bot token
- `OWNER_ID` - Discord user ID for admin commands

### Optional Settings (comment out if not using)
- `POINTS_CHANNEL_ID` - Channel where images trigger role assignment
- `OPENER_CHANNEL_ID` - Channel where open/close commands work
- `ROLE_PING_ID` - Role to ping when opening (default: 1352022044614590494)
- `VIP_ROLE_ID` - Role assigned with "Perm Fee" redemption (default: 1371247728646033550)
- `ORDER_CHANNEL_MENTION` - Channel mention in open announcement (default: <#1350935337269985334>)

### Pool Constants
The following are hardcoded but can be modified in the source:
- `EXP_MONTH = '06'` - Credit card expiration month
- `EXP_YEAR = '30'` - Credit card expiration year
- `ZIP_CODE = '19104'` - ZIP code for orders

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Card pool is empty" or "Email pool is empty"**
- Use `/add_card` and `/add_email` commands or bulk upload files
- Alternatively, use custom cards/emails to bypass pools entirely

**"Could not find order embed"**
- Ensure the ticket bot's first message contains at least 2 embeds
- The bot looks for the second embed in the first message of the channel

**Role assignment not working**
- Verify `POINTS_CHANNEL_ID` is set correctly
- Check that the bot has permissions to manage roles
- Ensure the target role ID (1350935336435449969) exists and bot can assign it

**Channel rename not working**
- Check bot has "Manage Channels" permission
- Verify `OPENER_CHANNEL_ID` matches the intended channel
- Remember there's a 2 renames per 10 minutes rate limit (Discord's limitation)

**Commands not appearing**
- Bot needs "applications.commands" scope when invited
- Commands sync automatically on startup
- Try `/` in Discord to see if commands appear

**Permission errors**
- Bot needs appropriate permissions in each channel it operates in:
  - View Channel, Send Messages, Read Message History (all channels)
  - Manage Channels (opener channel)
  - Manage Roles (for role assignment)

## Security Considerations

- All command responses are ephemeral (only visible to command user)
- Only the configured `OWNER_ID` can execute admin commands
- Card numbers and emails are logged in full - secure your log files appropriately
- Database files contain sensitive payment information - implement appropriate backups and security
- Consider rotating cards/emails regularly and removing old entries

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Card Expiration
Update the constants in the source file:
```python
EXP_MONTH = '12'  # December
EXP_YEAR = '25'   # 2025
ZIP_CODE = '90210'  # Beverly Hills
```

### Changing Role Assignment Target
Modify the role ID in the source file:
```python
# In the on_message event
target_role_id = 1350935336435449969  # Change this ID
```
